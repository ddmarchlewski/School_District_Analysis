# School_District_Analysis
Analyze data of school districts using Panda libraries and Python to show the performance of schools based on certain key metrics. 

## Challenge Overview 
Some students from Thomas High School were caught for academic dishonesty in the subjects math and reading. We are asked to redo the analysis and to replace the scores for those students with a NaN without removing them from the analysis. 

## Analysis Results
First, we needed to replace the ninth grade scores with a NaN. The code that was used is shown below as well as the output that followed.

From here, the analysis was redone, and the results show that the score replacements did not change very much. 
  
  --Total Students--
     
     The total amount of students remained unchanged. We only changed the scores for the students and didn't remove them from the analysis. 
  
  --Budget--

     The total budget reamined unchanged.
  
  --Average math score--
  
    The average math score is only .1 lower than the original.
  
  --Average reading score--
  
    The average reading score remained unchanged. 
    
  --Percentage of students passing math--
  
    The percentage of passing math was lowerd by .2 after changing the scores. 
    
  --Percentage of students passing reading--
  
    The percentage of passing reading was lowered by .3 after changing the scores.
    
  --Overall percentage of students that passed math and reading--
  
    The overall percentage of passing was lowered by .1 after changing the scores.

## Summary
After replacing the test scores with a NaN and redoing the analysis, there were four changes that occured in the analysis
  1. The average math score was lowered by .1
  2. The percentage of passing was was lowered by .2
  3. The percentage of passing reading was lowered by .3
  4. The overall percentage of passing was lowered by .1
