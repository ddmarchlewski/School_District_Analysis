# School_District_Analysis

## Challenge Overview 
Some students from Thomas High School were caught for academic dishonesty in the subjects math and reading. We are asked to redo the analysis and to replace the scores for those students with a NaN without removing them from the analysis. 

## Analysis Results
First, we needed to replace the ninth grade scores with a NaN. The code that was used is shown below as well as the output that followed.

From here, the analysis was redone, and the results show that the score replacements did not change very much. 
  The average math score is only .1 percent lower than the original.
  The average reading score remained unchanged.
